netsyslog enables you to send messages to a remote syslog server
directly from Python.

Classes for constructing UDP packets that can be sent to a remote
syslog server. It attempts to follow the protocol defined in RFC 3164.

The classes and attributes are named according to the terminology in
the RFC. In the absence of full documentation for this module you
should be able to read the RFC to work out how the code is
structured. If you are interested in sending syslog messages to a
remote server you shouldn't need to look any further than the Logger
class.
