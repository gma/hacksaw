INSTALL
=======

Installation is very straightforward. Simply run the following command
from a terminal in which you have administrator privileges:

    # python setup.py install

To test the installation ensure your syslog server is listening for
incoming connections, then run an interactive Python interpreter and
try the following code.

    $ python
    Python 2.4.1 (#2, Mar 30 2005, 21:51:10)
    [GCC 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-8ubuntu2)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import netsyslog
    >>> import syslog
    >>> logger = netsyslog.Logger()
    >>> logger.add_host("myhost")
    >>> logger.log(syslog.LOG_USER, syslog.LOG_INFO, "Test", pid=True)

You should see a log message appear in one of your syslog files
(probably /var/log/messages).
