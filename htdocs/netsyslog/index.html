      <h1>netsyslog</h1>

      <p>
	netsyslog enables you to construct syslog messages and send
	them (via UDP) to a remote syslog server directly from
	Python. Unlike other syslog modules it allows you to set the
	metadata (e.g. time, host name, program name, etc.) yourself,
	giving you full control over the contents of the UDP packets
	that it creates.
      </p>

      <p>
	netsyslog was initially developed for the Hack Saw project,
	where it was used to read log messages from a file and inject
	them into a network of syslog servers, whilst maintaining the
	times and hostnames recorded in the original messages.
      </p>

      <p>
	The module also allows you to send log messages that contain
	the current time, local hostname and calling program name
	(i.e. the typical requirement of a logging package) to one or
	more syslog servers.
      </p>

      <p>
	The format of the UDP packets sent by netsyslog adheres
	closely to that defined in
        <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt">RFC&nbsp;3164</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Installation</h2>

      <p>
	Though in an early stage of development netsyslog is already
	fully working and usable. It needs packaging, but in the
	meantime it is available from the Hack Saw project's CVS
	repository in the netsyslog module. To try it out simply
	checkout the latest code and run the following command:
      </p>

      <pre>
	python setup.py install</pre>

      <p>
	You should then be able to try sending a log message, as
	follows:
      </p>

      <pre>
        $ python
	Python 2.4.1 (#2, Mar 30 2005, 21:51:10)
	[GCC 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-8ubuntu2)] on linux2
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>> import netsyslog
	>>> import syslog
	>>> logger = netsyslog.Logger()
	>>> logger.include_pid()
	>>> logger.add_host("somehost.mydomain.com")
	>>> logger.add_host("otherhost.mydomain.com")
	>>> logger.log(syslog.LOG_USER, syslog.LOG_NOTICE, "Hey, it works!")</pre>

      <p>
	If you don't see your messages appearing on your syslog
	server, check the syslog configuration file and ensure that
	your server is configured to listen for incoming connections.
      </p>

      <h2>Documentation</h2>

      <p>
	The API is now documented. You may also benefit from reading
        parts of the RFC that defines the format of a syslog packet.
