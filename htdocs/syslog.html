      <h1>About Syslog</h1>

      <p>
	To quote 
	<a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/support/syslog.htm">
	  practicallynetworked.com</a>, syslog is:
	<blockquote>
	  ... an industry standard protocol used for capturing
	  log information for devices on a network, usually via UDP
	  Port 514.
	</blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>
	To put that another way, you can use it to monitor all manner
	of computers and network devices for information about what
	they're doing, or perhaps more importantly, what they're not
	doing!
      </p>

      <p>
	Syslog comes pre-installed with all standard Linux
	distributions, and other Unix like operating systems. You can
	also get
	<a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/support/syslog.htm">
	  syslog servers for Windows</a>, though Band Saw has not
	been developed with Windows users in mind.
      </p>
