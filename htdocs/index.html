      <h1>What is Hack Saw?</h1>

      <p>
	Hack Saw is a <a href="syslog.html">syslog</a> monitoring
	program for Unix. It allows the user to setup filters that
	define which messages should generate alerts. Combined with
	syslog's remote logging functionality it provides a scalable
	and easily deployed monitoring solution.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Hack Saw is released under the terms of the <a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public
	License</a>.
      </p>

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            
      <p>
	Hack Saw is really quite simple; it monitors messages that are
	fed to it from a suitably configured syslog server, looking
	out for messages that contain text that the administrator is
	interested in. Any log message that matches the
	administrator's filters will be brought to the user's
	attention via several different alerting mechanisms
	(e.g. email, desktop alerts).
      </p>

      <p>
	Because syslog itself supports propagating messages between
	seperate computers, with syslog and Hack Saw you can easily
	monitor a large number of computers for critical errors.
      </p>
