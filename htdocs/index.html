      <h1>What is Hack Saw?</h1>

      <p>
	Hack Saw is a log file transport mechanism. It was designed to
	work well for retrieving log messages from local servers or
	remote (and often inaccessible) computers. It works well
	through firewalls.
      </p>

      <p>
	Incoming log files can be saved to a local file, attached to
	an email or forwarded (via UDP, with <a
	href="netsyslog/">netsyslog</a>) to a syslog server. If you
	need to do something different (e.g. store the logs in a
	database) you can do so by writing a plug-in. Plug-ins are
	typically small, and are written in Python.
      </p>

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>

      <p>
	Log files are retrieved by <a
	href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/hacksaw/hacksaw/scripts/">scripts</a>
	(run regularly by cron) and then handled, on a message by
	message basis, by the <a
	href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/hacksaw/hacksaw/src/hacksaw/proc/">processors</a>
	that you've <a
	href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/hacksaw/hacksaw/etc/">configured</a>.
      </p>
